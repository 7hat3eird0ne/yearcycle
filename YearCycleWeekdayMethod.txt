1. If the current year isn't a leap year already, find out last leap year from the current year and remember the offset
    Note: leap year is always divisible by 4, centuries are never leap years unless divisble by 400

2. Get a remainder of the last leap year by 400

3. Find a initial year in extended year cycle which is the largest year smaller than the remainder, if remainder is 0, initial year is 373
    Extended Year Cycle Initial List:
        Saturday part:
            1
            29
            57
            85
        Friday part:
            125
            153
            181
        Wednesday Part:
            221
            249
            277
        Monday Part:
            317
            345
            373
    Note: EYCIL is biggest struggle in memorisation, if you want to use this in pracice, memorise only one or two which you are going to use in next decade.

4. Do calculation "(remainder - initial year) / 4"

5.
    if new number is 1:
        Leap year day is Thursday
    if new number is 2:
        Leap year day is Tuesday
    if new number is 3:
        Leap year day is Sunday
    if new number is 4:
        Leap year day is Friday
    if new number is 5:
        Leap year day is Wednesday
    if new number is 6:
        Leap year day is Monday
    if new number is 7:
        Leap year day is Saturday
    Note: You can memorise a sequence of numbers "6251473", with first number matching with Monday, second with Tuesday, etc.
    Note 2: By "leap year day", I mean first day of the original leap year you chose.

6. Offset the leap year day by same amount of days into future that you originaly offset to get the leap year, this way you now got first day of the year
    note: offset to get the leap year in years = offset to get the first day in the original year

7. Offset the first day of year by speciffic amount of days
    if current month is January:
        first day offset is 0
    if current month is February:
        first day offset is 3:
    if current month is March:
        first day offset is 3
    if current month is April:
        first day offset is 6
    if current month is May:
        first day offset is 1
    if current month is June:
        first day offset is 4
    if current month is July:
        first day offset is 6
    if current month is August:
        first day offset is 2
    if current month is September:
        first day offset is 5
    if current month is October:
        first day offset is 0
    if current month is November:
        first day offset is 3
    if current month is December:
        first day offset is 5
    Note: Again, memorisation of this list should be done only if planned to be used practicly, but if that's case, then it is much more importmant to memorise than EYCIL

8. If the current year is a leap year, and current month isn't January or February, offset the weekday by 1

9. Offset the weekday by remainder of the current day by 7

Congratulations, you have found the weekday of the date!
